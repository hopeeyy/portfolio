  <h2> Girls Who Code Reflections (This website is a work in progress, still figuring out to code) </h2>
<p1>July 19 2017,Today I was able to use Python to create shapes based on user inputs, similar to what I was able to do on scratch. It was difficult at first but eventually I was able to code what I was trying to accomplish.
   However Python is very different from the program Scratch in its level of difficulty. Scratch already has everything outlined for me whereas I have to type everything for myself.
